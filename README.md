Simple Calculator Program Overview

The simple calculator program is a Python script that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation to perform on those numbers. The program then performs the selected operation and displays the result to the user.

Key Features:

Prompts the user to enter two numbers
Allows the user to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)
Performs the selected operation on the input numbers
Displays the result to the user
Includes error handling to prevent division by zero
How it Works:

The user is prompted to enter two numbers, which are stored in variables num1 and num2.
The user is prompted to select an operation by entering a number (1-4).
Based on the selected operation, the corresponding function is called with num1 and num2 as arguments.
The result of the operation is stored in the result variable.
The result is displayed to the user.
Benefits:

Easy to use: The program is simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
Error handling: The program includes error handling to prevent division by zero, ensuring that the user is protected from invalid operations.
Flexibility: The program allows users to perform a variety of operations, making it a useful tool for quick calculations.
